const CODEBASE_SEARCH_DESCRIPTION = `Find snippets of code and text that are most relevant to the search query using semantic search. 
- Searches based on semanitc similarity rather than exact text matches. 
- By default searches entire workspace. 
- While this is semantic search, using the specific class names, function names, or technical terms provides the best results.
- Do NOT combine unrelated topics. If you need to find "User Login" AND "Database Settings," make TWO separate tool calls. Combined queries result in poor search.

Parameters:
- query: (required) The search query. Reuse the user's exact wording/question format unless there's a clear reason not to.
- path: (optional) Limit search to specific subdirectory (relative to the current workspace directory). Leave empty for entire workspace.

Example: Searching for user authentication code
{ "query": "User login and password hashing", "path": "src/auth" }

Example: Searching entire workspace
{ "query": "database connection pooling", "path": null }`

const QUERY_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Meaning-based search query describing the information you need`
